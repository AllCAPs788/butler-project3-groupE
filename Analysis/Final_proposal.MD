Proposal: What we want to know for our high-paying analyst jobs is which books are going to be popular (have the highest number of total reviews) based on a certain set of criteria. 

what are we using? Sci-kit, pandas/Google CoLab, tableau(?), Google Slides, 

What are we trying to predict? What is our target column as a means of comparison? What we want to predict is how popular books wil be based on... author, category, average_rating 



Target comparison column: ratings_count (i.e. exposure for titles)

User inputs for feedback: Author, category, published
