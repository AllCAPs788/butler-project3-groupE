Proposal:

What we want to know is which books are going to be popular (have the highest number of total reviews) based on a certain set of criteria. 

what are we using? Sci-kit, Pandas, Tableau, Google Slides (presentation for investors/CEOs), Postgres SQL

What are we trying to predict? 

What is our target column as a means of comparison? What we want to predict is how popular books wil be based on... author, category, average_rating, text_reviews_count, split publication data into mm/yyyy, publisher, 

Target comparison column: ratings_count (i.e. exposure for titles)


Databases: Postgres SQL
Deployment: Heroku
