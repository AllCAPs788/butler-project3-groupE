Proposal:

What we want to know is which books are going to be popular (have the highest number of total reviews) based on a certain set of criteria. 

what are we using? Sci-kit, Pandas, Tableau, Google Slides (presentation for investors/CEOs), Postgres SQL

What are we trying to predict? 

Based on your choices, we will provide you recommendations based on title, author, publisher, and categories (genres) to let you expand on your tastes.
