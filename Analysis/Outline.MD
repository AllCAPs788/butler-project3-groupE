 MyNextBook

Reading is one of my favorite hobbies. As an avid reader, once I finish a book or more often, a series of books, I’m always looking to find my next book that I want to read. In comes MyNextBook, a machine learning app that your group will create to help those curious about new book recommendations.

How will we accomplish this? I found a couple of datasets:
The first is a pure catalogue of books and their genres,descriptions,etc…
https://www.kaggle.com/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata 
And the second one focused on how well reviewed these books were. https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks  

Bonus, the first dataset drew all their ISBN numbers from the second one so these two sets are perfectly compatible.

Where does machine learning come in?
I was thinking of using a combination of the genre, keywords in the description, similar review ratings, etc to help generate a list of potential book choices based on a book that is selected.

What are we using? Google Colab/Pandas and Sci-kit learn

Strengths? Weaknesses?
* Not sure I've fully absorbed machine learning (if at all)
* strengths: presentation materials, analysis
